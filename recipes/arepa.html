        <h2>Homemaade Arepas</h2>
        <p>Arepa (Spanish pronunciation: [aɾepa]) is a type of 
            food made of ground maize dough, eaten in the northern
             region of South America since pre-Columbian times, and
              notable primarily in the cuisine of Colombia and 
              Venezuela, but also present in the cuisines of 
              Bolivia[1] and other countries. </p>
        <p>It is commonly eaten in those countries and can be served with 
            accompaniments such as cheese,[3] cuajada (fresh cheese), various
             meats, chicken, avocado, or diablito (deviled ham spread). 
             It can also be split to make sandwiches. Sizes, maize types, 
             and added ingredients vary its preparation. It is similar to the 
             Mexican gordita, the Salvadoran pupusa, the Ecuadorian tortilla 
             de maíz[4] and the Panamanian tortilla or changa</p>
        <uL>
            <li>2½ cups lukewarm water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups pre-cooked white cornmeal</li>
            <li>2½ cups lukewarm water</li>
        </uL>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir water and salt together in a medium bowl; gradually stir in 
                cornmeal with your fingers until the mixture forms a soft, 
                moist, malleable dough.</li>
            <li>Form dough into eight 2-inch diameter balls; pat each ball to flatten
                 into a 3/8-inch-thick arepa patty.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry arepas in batches until 
                golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked arepas to a 
                paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to handle.</li>
            <li>Slice halfway through each arepa horizontally with a thin serrated knife to form a 
                pita-like pocket.</li>
