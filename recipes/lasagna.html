        <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd 
            and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats 
            well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>

        <p>Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite 
            recipe for lasagna which he has been cooking since his 
            college days. Alton's original recipe created enough 
            lasagna for a small army so I halved it. 
            What is posted here will easily serve eight people.</p>
