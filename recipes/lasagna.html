        <h2>Homemade Lasagna</h2>

        <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd 
            and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats 
            well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>

        <p>Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite 
            recipe for lasagna which he has been cooking since his 
            college days. Alton's original recipe created enough 
            lasagna for a small army so I halved it. 
            What is posted here will easily serve eight people.</p>
        <ul>
            <Li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
            <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li><p>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic
                 over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, 
                 tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, 
                 fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 
                 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, 
                 stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna 
                noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles,
                 and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta 
                 cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 
                9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce.
                 Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a t
                 hird of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce 
                 over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. 
                 Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and 
                 Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, e
                 ither spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil 
                 does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake 
                an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving. </li>
        </ol>
